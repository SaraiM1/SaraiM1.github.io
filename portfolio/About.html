<h3 class="text-center">Artist Statement</h3>

<p class="text-center"> â€‹Hey there, my name is Sarai, and I am the artist of this website. 
I am currently a DMA student exploring the digital world using different type of software in order to create art! </p>

<p>I have a lot of passion when it comes to things I love, and art has been one of those things. Hello, my name is Sarai Mateo and one day I want to work somewhere I can make art and help make a difference. Ideally, I would like to work with more independent clients/companies because I have realized I like working with smaller communities. This does not mean I am opposed to working with more well-established companies, I would be more than happy to work for something bigger with more people, and later come back with more experience and expertise to clients who need assistance or advise.</p>
 
<p>I have some work experience in the marketing department, I really enjoy creating flyers or working on newsletters. These tasks helped me make up my mind in wanting to work in marketing since I found it creatively enjoyable. Being from Generation Z, I grew up in a world where technology was on the rise which gave me the advantage of being able to use computer technology almost daily and learned how to be tech savvy at a young age.</p>
 
<p>A medium I use a lot is digital illustration, which is one of my favorite things to work with. I do most of my illustrations on Procreate for fun and use Adobe Illustrator for work-related purposes. Although I also use Photoshop for a lot of work as well. In my portfolio you will see digital artworks done using: Procreate, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, html code, ps.5 code, Adobe InDesign, and Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
 
<p>Concepts and topics I mention in my portfolio are about things I am interested in or are important to me. Topics such as mental health and food waste can be seen in my work. My art also tends to be colorful; I enjoy creating art that is both eye-catching and appealing to the eye.</p>
 
<p>So far on my scholarly journey I have learned to do digital and traditional art. However, digital art has really caught my attention since there is so much to learn, and SJSU has opened my eyes to art such as coding in html. I mention SJSU specifically because I am a transfer student and barely learned any coding at community college. It was not until my first semester at San Jose State that I learned how to code and have now been able to start coding. This opportunity has been opening a whole new technological world for me such as web design, which is something that would help me in a marketing career.</p>
 
<p>Being able to expand my knowledge in digital media is very important to me because knowing how to use different software and media and how they can work with each other will help me make sure I am able to do my best work. I believe that getting my BFA in DMA will allow me to have a successful marketing career especially since I want to help businesses that are starting out.</p>
